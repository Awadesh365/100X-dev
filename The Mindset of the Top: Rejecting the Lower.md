# **The Mindset of the Top: Rejecting the Lower, Choosing the Highest**  

The difference between those who succeed at the highest level and those who remain stuck in mediocrity is not just talent or luck—it is their mindset. The top achievers in the world operate with a different set of standards. They do not waste time on petty issues, low-value desires, or cheap dopamine hits. Instead, they set their eyes on the highest goals and accept nothing less.  

Many people believe that success means having more money, a bigger house, or a luxury car. While these things are good, the true mindset of the top is about **aiming for something far greater than just material success**. It is about choosing **purpose over pleasure, depth over distractions, and legacy over momentary satisfaction**.  

## **1. Stop Chasing Cheap Dopamine: Seek Real Rewards**  

Dopamine is the chemical in your brain that makes you feel rewarded. The problem is that most people chase **cheap dopamine**—short-term pleasures that give an instant high but leave them feeling empty.  

🚫 **Examples of cheap dopamine:**  
- Mindlessly scrolling on social media for hours  
- Playing video games all day with no purpose  
- Binge-watching TV shows and wasting time  
- Seeking validation from others through likes and comments  
- Getting angry over small things like traffic or minor inconveniences  

✅ **Examples of real dopamine:**  
- Building a successful business that impacts millions  
- Mastering a skill that makes you world-class  
- Achieving financial freedom and helping others  
- Winning championships, breaking records, and leaving a legacy  
- Overcoming challenges that most people give up on  

### **People Who Choose Real Dopamine Over Cheap Dopamine**  
- **Elon Musk**: Instead of wasting time on entertainment, he focuses on solving problems like space travel, AI, and electric cars. His dopamine hit comes from making history.  
- **Cristiano Ronaldo**: Instead of partying and drinking, he spends hours training every day. His dopamine comes from scoring goals and winning trophies.  
- **Steve Jobs**: Instead of settling for an average tech company, he obsessed over creating world-changing products. His dopamine came from building Apple into a global empire.  

If you want to feel good, **earn it**. Do things that actually **improve your life** instead of temporary pleasures that leave you weaker.  

## **2. Set the Highest Standards: Discard the Lower Ones**  

Most people set **low standards** for themselves. They accept mediocrity because it is comfortable. But those at the top never settle—they constantly push for higher levels of achievement.  

🚫 **Low-standard mindset:**  
- “As long as I have a stable job, I’m fine.”  
- “I don’t need to work out, I’m not that fat.”  
- “I’ll just do the bare minimum and get by.”  

✅ **High-standard mindset:**  
- “I will build something extraordinary, not just ‘good enough.’”  
- “I will push my body and mind to peak performance.”  
- “I will not stop until I am among the best in my field.”  

### **Examples of People with High Standards**  
- **Jeff Bezos** didn’t just want a small online bookstore—he aimed to create the world’s biggest e-commerce empire (Amazon).  
- **Michael Jordan** didn’t just want to play basketball—he wanted to become the greatest player of all time.  
- **Mukesh Ambani** didn’t settle for a profitable company—he built Reliance into one of the most powerful businesses in the world.  

When you accept **low standards**, you stay **average**. When you **demand excellence**, you rise to the top.  

## **3. Desire the Highest, Not the Ordinary**  

There is nothing wrong with wanting money, comfort, or a good life. But if that’s your **only** goal, you will never reach true greatness. The most successful people **desire something much bigger than just personal luxury**.  

🚫 **Small desires:**  
- Wanting to just “make enough money to survive”  
- Wishing for a little more success than your friends  
- Seeking short-term pleasures instead of long-term growth  

✅ **Big desires:**  
- Creating a business, movement, or invention that changes the world  
- Becoming the absolute best in your field  
- Pushing human potential beyond limits  

### **Examples of People Who Aimed High**  
- **Oprah Winfrey** didn’t just want to be a famous TV host—she wanted to inspire millions and built an empire in the process.  
- **Warren Buffett** didn’t just want to be a rich investor—he became the most disciplined, long-term investor in history.  
- **Arnold Schwarzenegger** didn’t just want to be fit—he aimed to become the greatest bodybuilder of all time, and he did.  

If you have to **desire something**, desire the **best**. Small desires lead to small results. Big desires lead to big achievements.  

## **4. Compare Yourself with the Best, Not the Average**  

Most people compare themselves with their friends, colleagues, or neighbors. They feel good if they are slightly better than the people around them. But the top achievers don’t compete with the **average**—they compete with the **greatest in history**.  

🚫 **Small comparison mindset:**  
- “I make more money than my friends, so I’m doing fine.”  
- “I work out more than my coworkers, so I’m in good shape.”  
- “I’m smarter than most people I know, so I don’t need to improve.”  

✅ **High-level comparison mindset:**  
- “Who are the absolute best in my field, and how can I reach their level?”  
- “What is the highest possible standard of success, and how close am I?”  
- “What would it take for me to be one of the best in the world?”  

### **Examples of the Best Competing with the Best**  
- **Usain Bolt** didn’t compete with his local runners—he competed with Olympic legends and became the fastest man alive.  
- **Kobe Bryant** didn’t compare himself with average NBA players—he modeled his game after Michael Jordan.  
- **Bill Gates** didn’t aim to be a rich businessman—he aimed to build a tech empire bigger than anyone had imagined.  

If you must compare, **compare with the greatest**, not with those who are slightly ahead of you.  

## **5. Let Go of Small Attachments: Focus on the Ultimate Goal**  

People who stay stuck in mediocrity hold on to things that slow them down—bad habits, toxic relationships, and meaningless distractions. The top achievers **sacrifice** what is unnecessary so they can focus entirely on their purpose.  

🚫 **Things to let go of:**  
- Being angry over small things like insults or traffic  
- Comparing yourself with people at your level instead of the highest level  
- Holding on to bad habits that waste time and energy  
- Seeking approval from people who don’t matter  

✅ **Things to focus on:**  
- Mastering your craft and becoming world-class  
- Building something that lasts beyond your lifetime  
- Creating real impact instead of chasing small victories  

### **Examples of Extreme Focus**  
- **Buddha** left behind a life of luxury to seek enlightenment and changed the course of human history.  
- **Steve Jobs** sacrificed comfort and stability to build Apple into one of the most valuable companies ever.  
- **Michael Phelps** trained with insane discipline, cutting out distractions, to become the greatest Olympic swimmer of all time.  

**Greatness requires sacrifice.** If you hold on to everything, you gain nothing. If you focus on your **ultimate goal**, you can achieve **anything**.

## **Conclusion: Think Big, Act Bold, and Refuse to Settle**  
- **Reject cheap dopamine**—seek real achievement.  
- **Set the highest standards**—never accept mediocrity.  
- **Desire the greatest**—small dreams lead to small results.  
- **Compete with the best**—not with the average.  
- **Let go of distractions**—focus on what truly matters.  

The mindset of the top is simple: **Choose the highest and discard the rest.** Success is not a matter of luck—it is a matter of **choosing greatness every single day**.
